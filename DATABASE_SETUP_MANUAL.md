# 🗄️ Database Setup Guide

## Quick Setup (5 minutes)

Since the Supabase CLI isn't accessible in this environment, we'll set up the database manually through the Supabase Dashboard.

### Step 1: Open Supabase SQL Editor

Click here to open your SQL Editor:
👉 **https://app.supabase.com/project/ialxlykysbqyiejepzkx/sql/new**

### Step 2: Run the Complete Setup Script

1. Open the file `COMPLETE_DATABASE_SETUP.sql` (2,038 lines)
2. Copy **ALL** content from that file
3. Paste it into the Supabase SQL Editor
4. Click "Run" (or press Ctrl+Enter)
5. Wait for completion (~10-15 seconds)

### Step 3: Verify Tables Created

Visit the Table Editor to confirm all tables were created:
👉 **https://app.supabase.com/project/ialxlykysbqyiejepzkx/editor**

You should see these tables:
- ✅ profiles
- ✅ categories
- ✅ equipment
- ✅ bookings
- ✅ reviews
- ✅ favorites
- ✅ notifications
- ✅ messages
- ✅ conversations
- ✅ conversation_participants
- ✅ user_analytics
- ✅ equipment_analytics
- ✅ equipment_availability
- ✅ saved_searches
- ✅ verification_requests
- ✅ audit_logs
- ✅ user_sessions
- ✅ platform_settings
- ✅ email_preferences
- ✅ email_logs
- ✅ payment_methods
- ✅ transactions
- ✅ push_subscriptions

### Step 4: (Optional) Add Sample Data

If you want to test with sample data, run:
```bash
cat setup-database.sql
```

Then copy the seed data section and run it in SQL Editor.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "relation already exists"
This means some tables already exist. You can either:
1. Drop existing tables first (⚠️ **loses all data**):
   ```sql
   DROP SCHEMA public CASCADE;
   CREATE SCHEMA public;
   ```
2. Or skip to the verification step if tables are already set up

### Error: "permission denied"
Make sure you're using the Service Role key in the SQL Editor, not the Anon key.

### Error: "syntax error"
Make sure you copied the **entire** SQL file without missing any characters.
