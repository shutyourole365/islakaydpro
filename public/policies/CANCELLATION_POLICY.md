# Cancellation Policy

**Effective Date:** February 7, 2026

At Islakayd, we understand that plans can change. This Cancellation Policy outlines the terms and conditions for canceling bookings on our equipment rental platform. By making a booking, you agree to this policy.

## 1. Cancellation Windows

### 1.1 Free Cancellation Period
- **Short-term Rentals (1-7 days):** You can cancel your booking up to 48 hours before the rental start time for a full refund.
- **Long-term Rentals (8+ days):** You can cancel up to 72 hours before the rental start time for a full refund.
- **Last-minute Bookings:** If the booking is made less than 24 hours before the rental start time, cancellations are not eligible for refunds.

### 1.2 Partial Refunds
- **24-48 hours before start:** 50% refund
- **Less than 24 hours before start:** No refund
- **After rental start:** No refund, unless equipment is unusable due to our fault

## 2. Equipment-Specific Policies

Some equipment owners may have stricter cancellation policies. These will be clearly stated in the equipment listing and booking confirmation. In such cases, the equipment owner's policy takes precedence.

## 3. Refund Processing

### 3.1 Refund Timeline
Refunds are processed within 5-7 business days after cancellation approval. The method of refund depends on the original payment method.

### 3.2 Fees
- Service fees are non-refundable once a booking is confirmed.
- Deposit refunds are subject to equipment inspection upon return.

### 3.3 Exceptions
- If the rental is canceled due to force majeure (e.g., natural disasters, government restrictions), full refunds may apply.
- If we cancel a booking due to equipment unavailability, you will receive a full refund plus any applicable compensation.

## 4. How to Cancel

- Follow the prompts to confirm

### 4.2 Contact Us
For urgent cancellations or issues, contact our support team at [support email/phone] or through the in-app chat.

## 5. No-Show Policy

If you do not pick up the equipment at the agreed time without prior cancellation, it may be considered a no-show. In such cases:
- No refund will be issued
- You may be charged a no-show fee up to the full rental amount
- Your account may be flagged for future restrictions

## 6. Modifications to Bookings

Requests to modify booking dates, equipment, or other details are treated as cancellations and new bookings. Cancellation fees may apply based on the timing.

## 7. Disputes and Appeals

If you disagree with a cancellation decision, contact our support team within 7 days of the cancellation. We will review the case and may offer partial refunds or other resolutions.

## 8. Changes to This Policy
